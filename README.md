Cancel Christmas!
-----------------

Cancel Christmas is a hacker simulation game made for Ludum Dare 25. It will teach you (actually it will mostly just expect you to already know) the basics of:

  - SQL injection
  - buffer overflows
  - integer overflows
  - christmas movies

It also features a very annoying 8 second music loop.

Enjoy!
