Cancel Christmas!
-----------------

Cancel Christmas is a hacker simulation game made for Ludum Dare 25. It will teach you (actually it will mostly just expect you to already know) the basics of:

  - SQL injection
  - buffer overflows
  - integer overflows
  - christmas movies

It also features a very annoying 8 second music loop.

Windows
-------

- Download the zip file, extract it, and run the .bat. If the .bat doesn't work (I have no idea what I'm doing on Windows), run the cancelchristmas.exe file directly

Linux
-----
Download the source zip and extract it to a directory. For debian based distros, issue the command

  sudo apt-get install python-pygame python-opengl python-numpy

Then run python cancelchristmas.py

Mac OS
------

Install python,pygame,pyOpenGL and numpy however you can (maybe ports or some such?), then proceed as per the linux instructions

Enjoy!
